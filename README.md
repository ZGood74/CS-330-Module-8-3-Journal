# 3D Scene Project

This project is a 3D scene created as part of my computational graphics coursework. It demonstrates my understanding of scene management, lighting, and rendering techniques to create a realistic office setup, including objects like a book, pencils, a coffee mug, glasses, and a lamp.

## Files Overview

### Key Code Files
- **MainCode.cpp**: Contains the main function, initializing and setting up the 3D scene.
- **SceneManager.cpp/h**: Manages the arrangement and behavior of scene objects, including adding and organizing elements within the scene.
- **ViewManager.cpp/h**: Controls the camera perspective and view adjustments, enabling dynamic rendering and user viewpoint control.

## Reflection on Project Development

### How do I approach designing software?
For this project, I approached software design by first defining the requirements and the core components needed for a 3D scene. I identified key elements, such as scene layout, object positioning, and lighting requirements, to ensure the scene would look realistic and cohesive. By planning ahead, I created a clear roadmap for the project and was able to break down the tasks into manageable parts.

- **New Design Skills**: Working on this project has helped me improve my spatial awareness and scene composition skills, particularly in arranging objects in a 3D space for realism.
- **Design Process Followed**: My design process included brainstorming, prototyping with simple shapes, and gradually refining each component’s detail, texture, and placement.
- **Future Application**: These design tactics, such as prototyping and iterative refinement, will be valuable in future projects where visual realism and scene structure are crucial.

### How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I focus on building the fundamental structure first and then adding functionality step-by-step. In this 3D scene, I first ensured that core elements like object models and basic lighting worked before refining materials and adjusting camera angles.

- **New Development Strategies**: I experimented with lighting techniques to enhance the scene’s realism, adjusting ambient and specular lighting to create the right atmosphere.
- **Role of Iteration**: Iteration was critical as I repeatedly tested and adjusted the lighting, textures, and object placements to achieve the desired look.
- **Evolution of Approach**: Throughout the project milestones, my approach evolved from simply placing objects to fine-tuning every detail, from lighting and reflections to texture mapping, which led to a more polished final product.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science, and specifically computational graphics, equips me with the skills to bring creative ideas to life through visual representations. Working on this project has given me a stronger foundation in understanding how graphics are rendered and managed in software, which aligns with my career goals.

- **Educational Pathway**: This project has given me hands-on experience with 3D rendering techniques, which will enhance my understanding of graphics courses and projects in the future.
- **Professional Pathway**: The knowledge of computational graphics and visualization gained here is applicable to careers in game development, simulation, and any field that requires the presentation of complex visual information.
